# Advent Of Code - Fioco

This repository contains my Advent Of Code (AOC) solutions.

## Input files

Input is not shared due to AOC ToS. Every solution reads input from stdin. I
store input files under `input/<year>/dXX.txt`, so an execution may be
`/usr/bin/python3 python/2025/d01.py < input/2025/d01.txt`. This is also
standard input files directory used by `runner`.
